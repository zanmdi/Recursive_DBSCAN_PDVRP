# Recursive_DBSCAN_PDVRP

This repository contains a recursive implementation of **DBSCAN clustering** applied to the **Pickup and Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (PDVRP)**.  
The approach enables efficient grouping of pickup and delivery locations to support optimal route planning and improve computational performance.  

The flowchart illustrating the overall process is shown below:
